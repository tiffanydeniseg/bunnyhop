         <P>My partners and I created a mini game called Zombie Warfare. 
            Through Scratch, I used the block programming language to code the functions for the characters of the game.
            For instance, the character, Scarlett, is controlled by functions which we implemented as an algorithm so that it acts as a loop for all levels of the game.
            This applies to the game because her controls were movements based on what keys were pressed. The gamer is supposed to have free control over the character throughout the game.
            A problem I had was simplifying my code. I found that I had to continuously code my character's functions throughout the levels, which was tedious. So, to fix this,
            I defined a function called, "Scarlett Controls" on her script. This function was useful because it allowed me to apply to Scarlett's controls during each level of the game 
            to reduce the amount of coding in each level. In the coding shown above, you can see the purple block, which contains her movements. I was then able to use this block code 
            and apply it to the leves. I placed the defined function under each "When I receive: level 1, level 2, and level 3" so that when the gamer was transitioned to the next leve, they could still be able to control Scarlet's movements. 
            One thing I learned is that an algorithm can be used to repeat certain functions or controls to make the coding simple, but efficient.
         </P>

      <P>My program called "Quiz Game" is an application that is directed mainly to students to help them test themselves on terms and definitions
      that they need to study for any upcoming tests or fun. Using my app, they can create a list of flashcards and put their terms 
      with corresponding definitions. This application is helpful because it tests them on whether they know the definitions of the terms they input.
      The Quiz game randomizes the definitions as the answer choices. I used an algorithm to enable the user to input their terms and definitions into a list. 
      The list contains their terms and corresponding definitions.  One of my difficulties while making this application was figuring out how to save the user's information, such as the
      list they title and the terms with definitions under the specific category of list that they create. To save their information, I used a data base to store it. The data base 
      called their information if it was needed. For example, whenever the user chooses a list of terms they want to be quizzed on, the information is then retrieved from the 
      data base in the program where it is stored and will display on their screen.

            In my python project, I chose an image of my family's cat, Patrick!
            My goal with this project was to create a modified version of the image through python coding.
            Python coding has been difficult for me but, I realized that it is important to understand the logic behind the coding and then be able to use it correctly. 
            I learned that there is an installed PIL library and that is how it programmatically represent the image. 
            The image module of "kitty.jpg" could then have functions applied to it. 
            I saved it onto the variable "im" so that I can later refer to it later in the program. 
            Then, through the help of online sources and my cousin Daphne, I figured out how to code the enhancement filters and modified my images.
            I decided to make three different modifications, such as flipped, blackAndWhite, and embossed. 
            As you can see the four images above with captions show the outcome of my coding!
            I think researching more and understanding the logic of the language has helped me become more efficient in my coding and keep it simple within 7 lines of coding.

              In class, we were assigned to make a pie chart using Python to code it. I learned how to change certain details about the pie chart in order to show my data more accurately. In this particular pie chart, we displayed 
              the number of people who are employed or unemployed in Sales and Office Occupations during 2017. We gathered information 
              and data from the Burea of Labor Statistics!

        <p> For my presentation, I talked about how big data is incorporated into this tracking device in terms of volume. I chose a location tracker device that is used in an emergency to locate the lost person's 
        location without wi-fi signals.</p>
